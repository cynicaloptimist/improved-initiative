The official Improved Initiative app lives at https://www.improved-initiative.com

To run, install node.js and run the following in the cloned directory:

`npm install`

`npm start`

Once the Improved Initiative app is running, the ui can be accessed at <http://localhost>

You can start the dev build process by running `grunt`. This will automatically rebuild the project when you change any typescript files.
